//This may be the simplest way if you want to test every character in a string:

put not one character of "_$£" is an alphanumeric

//If you're just testing one character at a time, you can do:

put "_" is not an alphanumeric

//You can also do some things with patterns, like:
put "_$£" matches <one or more nonalphanumeric>
